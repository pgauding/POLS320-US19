\begin_layout Title
POLS 320 - US21 - Discussion Board Prompts
\end_layout

\begin_layout Author
Patrick Gauding
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
L1 Discussion Board
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
How much government intrusion into daily life is acceptable? Do you think
 government is morally or ethically obligated to address some questions?
 If so, what are some examples?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
L2 Discussion Board
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There has been a lot of debate recently regarding the level of public assistance
 that should go to the poor and the related question of personal responsibility.
 Should we move in the direction of less public support for the poor? If
 so, what are the implications? If not, what should be done?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
L3 Discussion Board
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Should education and environmental policies remain primarily a state and
 local government concern, or should the federal government be involved?
 What are the arguments for the federal government to be more involved in
 education and environmental policy? What advantages do states have in maintaini
ng their responsibility in these policy areas?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
L4 Discussion Board
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Much of the policy analysis that is used in public debates today comes from
 interest groups that are strongly committed to one side of the issue or
 another or from think tanks that espouse a particular ideology on the left
 or the right.
 Do you think these policy commitments make the quality of the analysis
 suspect? Why or why not?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
L5 Discussion Board
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consider the use of policy tools (p.
 158) such as authority tools, inducements or sanctions, capacity building,
 hortatory, and learning tools in the problem of texting and driving.
 Which of these tools might be the most effective in reducing cell phone
 use or texting by drivers? Why do you think so? Do you think these tools
 would be more or less effective applied to another issue, say drug consumption?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
L6 Discussion Board
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Watch

\end_inset

 before posting.
 Drug courts have been shown to be an efficient way to deal with persons
 having drug offenses.
 They are shown to be effective in reducing recidivism and to save government
 money.
 After watching the video, what is your view of this policy tool, the drug
 court? Why arenâ€™t they more prevalent? What issues might prevent a community
 from having a drug court?
